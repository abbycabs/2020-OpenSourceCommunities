  - Submit trivial fixes (for example, a typo, a broken link or an obvious error)
  - Start work on a contribution that is already listed as an issue, or something you‚Äôve already discussed
  - A pull request doesn‚Äôt have to represent finished work. It‚Äôs usually better to open a
  pull request early on, so others can watch or give feedback on your progress.
  You can mark it as a ‚ÄúWIP‚Äù (Work in Progress) in the subject line. You can always add more commits later.
